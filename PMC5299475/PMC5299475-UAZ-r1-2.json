  "verbose_text" : "In case of Cu-particles on Zn, rapid sintering owing to a change of the redox potentials was observed.13 Similarly, an accelerated deactivation of Ni-catalysts by fast bulk oxidation was found in the methanation of CO 2 after removal of H 2 from a H 2 / CO 2 (4:1) gas stream.80 In electrocatalysis, to identify the degradation process in fuel cell catalysts, typically several 10 000 start-stop cycles are performed and the resulting changes in the properties of the catalysts are subsequently analyzed.116 Several coupled degradation mechanisms, such as dissolution, agglomeration, and detachment of particles, as well as corrosion of the support (see also Figure XREF_FIG) were found for Pt supported catalysts.16 However, dynamic reaction conditions do not necessarily have a negative influence on the catalyst performance.",
