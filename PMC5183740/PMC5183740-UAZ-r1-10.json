  "verbose_text" : "In order to obtain non covalent complexes of the AGs with the targeting anti-CD11c antibody, we produced SA-AG protein fusions, where the conserved IAV AG, e.g., NP, three repeated copies of the M2e (3M2e) or the HA2 stem segment were fused to the tetramerizing core of SA, as schematically depicted in Figure XREF_FIG A. Tetrameric forms of purified SA-AG fusion proteins bind biotin conjugated antibodies to form VC due to the very high affinity of binding interaction between biotin and tetrameric SA (Kd 10 -15 M).",
