  "verbose_text" : "Pigmentary abnormalities occurring within two disc diameters of the macular centre carry a strong association with the subsequent development of late AMD and should be identified in all AMD patients.34 The IR appearance of pigmentary changes in AMD varies between discrete, clumped deposits of intense hyper-reflectivity 23, 54 and hypo-reflectivity.15 This likely relates to the non uniform deposition of melanin and other compounds, such as lipofuscinoid fluorophores and pigmented melanocytes.54 Pigmentary changes that appear hyper-reflective on IR imaging likely feature higher levels of melanin relative to surrounding retina.",
