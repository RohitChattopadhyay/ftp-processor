  "verbose_text" : "We demonstrated that : i) TGF-beta 1 induced alpha-SMA expression in the cultured CFs in a time- and concentration dependent manner; the maximal expression of alpha-SMA protein was investigated in the CFs treated with 5 ng/ml TGF-beta 1 for 48 h; ii) HGF inhibited the proliferation of CFs; iii) HGF inhibited the differentiation of CFs into myofibroblasts; iv) HGF decreased the synthesis and secretion of collagen I and III in the CFs; v) HGF activated the phosphorylation of its receptor, c-Met; vi) TGF-beta 1 stimulation increased the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, downstream of c-Met, but the knockdown or the overexpression of HGF did not alter the phosphorylation levels of the aforementioned signaling molecules; vii) the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 was enhanced in the CFs following stimulation with TGF-beta 1, but there was no difference between HGF knockdown and HGF overexpression; viii) the phosphorylation of Akt and total protein of TGIF were significantly suppressed in the CFs in which HGF was knocked down, but increased in the CFs in which HGF was overexpressed following TGF-beta 1 stimulation.",
