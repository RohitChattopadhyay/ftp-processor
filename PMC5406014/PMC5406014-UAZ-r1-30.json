  "verbose_text" : "That this effect on ALT could be directly attributed to Poleta depletion was demonstrated by (1) the depletion of Poleta with a single siRNA targeting the 3 ' UTR of its mRNA that also elicited a robust increase of total percentage of APB positive cells in U2OS cells and (2) the suppression of this elevated APB phenotype when Poleta expression levels were restored by ectopic expression of FLAG tagged wild-type (WT) Poleta cDNA in U2OS cells that were depleted of endogenous Poleta by this single siRNA (XREF_FIG).",
