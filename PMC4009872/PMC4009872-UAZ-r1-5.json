  "verbose_text" : "Two cyanobacterial pigments, myxoxanthophyll and nostoxanthin, showed a decline in relative abundance with depth to 14 m, whereas three pigments associated with diatoms, chlorophyll-c, diadinoxanthin and fucoxanthin, increased to 14 m. Two taxonomically widespread carotenoids, beta-carotene and canthaxanthin, all tended to decline gradually with depth and reached minima at 26 m. Of the recognized chlorophyll-a derivatives, when expressed as ratio to chlorophyll-a, an allomer, phaeophytin and phaeophorbide increased with depth to 22 m, whereas chlorophyllides showed only a slight increase in relative abundance with depth.",
