Serum level of AMH has been demonstrated to be a good prognostic marker for poor ovarian response, cycle cancellation and hyper-response to COS. Importantly, a recent large prospective (but non randomized) study suggested that an AMH based approach to individualize treatment strategies for COS may result in a reduced risk of hyper-response with maintained pregnancy rates.",
