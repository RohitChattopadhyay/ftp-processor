  "verbose_text" : "It should be pointed out that the enzyme encoded by this gene conducts the reaction of phenylalanine transformation to t-cinnamic acid, and it is the major enzyme from the phenylpropanoid pathway, which is the source of important second metabolites in plants, i.e. lignin, flavonoids, lignans, etc. Although observed overexpression of the PAL gene in plants from line 7 was not statistically significant it reflects higher lignin content in this line, and also the reduction in the expression of this gene in plants from line 11 confers a decrease of lignin level.",
