  "verbose_text" : "In the field of p-LT TMA, different risk factors have been linked : ischemia-reperfusion injury, immunosuppressive medications particularly CNIs (cyclosporine A and tacrolimus), interfering disease and relative ADAMTS13 deficiency.2 Calcineurin inhibitors administration as a risk factor is not a new concept5, 15, 16 but has recently been discussed.17 Their disease triggering effects have been linked to their ability to cause endothelial dysfunction resulting in vasoconstriction and increased platelet aggregation, possibly through the inhibition of prostacyclin.2, 5 However, CNIs are extensively used in transplanted patients and only a limited number of them will develop TMA, which can suggest the presence of another underlying factor.17 Likewise, CNIs withdrawal does not always guarantee a recovery.2, 17 mTOR inhibitors (as sirolimus) have also been reported to be implicated in the pathogenesis of TMA, probably due to their antiangiogenic properties.2 However, they are also used as rescue medication in cases of CNI induced TMA.8, 16, 17 Recent studies suggest that a relative defect in ADAMTS13 could contribute to the pathogenesis, more precisely an imbalance between ADAMTS13 and unusually large vWF multimers (UL-vWFM).2, 6, 7 vWFpp is synthesized in endothelial cells and cleaved to form vWF.",
