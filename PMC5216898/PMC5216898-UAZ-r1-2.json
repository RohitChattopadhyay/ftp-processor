  "verbose_text" : "This signal is termed GABA+, as the GABA 3 ppm signal that appears in edited MRS spectra can contain macromolecule (MM) signals.3, 4, 5, 6 GABA+ signals can also be evaluated by the peak area ratio of GABA+ to a reference compound such as Cr, N-acetylaspartate, or water.7 However, the concentrations and longitudinal- and transverse relaxation times (T 1 and T 2) of these reference compounds change during development.8, 9 Thus, use of these methods for assessment of neonatal GABA levels may be inaccurate.",
