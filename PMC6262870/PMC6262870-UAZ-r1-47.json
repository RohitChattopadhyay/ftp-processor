  "verbose_text" : "To find out whether the impaired availability of integrin beta1 has any long-term consequences after re-seeding, the hES cells were detached using different methods and grown for a further 72 h. Flow cytometry revealed that the levels of integrin beta1 on the membrane were similar in all groups notwithstanding the detachment techniques used for re-seeding, indicating that the initially induced differences on the level of adhesion molecules on the plasma membrane were lost during culturing and that the integrins were endocytosed and recycled back to the plasma membrane (XREF_FIG F).",
