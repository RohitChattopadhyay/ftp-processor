  "verbose_text" : "Zinc is essential for physiological functions and is involved in multiple biochemical mechanisms contributing to growth and development.10 Zinc levels maintain homeostasis via two groups of zinc transporter proteins, ZIPs which shift zinc into the cytosol and ZnTs which shift zinc from the cytosol to extracellular and intracellular compartments.11 These transporter proteins help in preventing zinc toxicity; however, there is little research on how gastric bypass surgery and other malabsorptive conditions affect transporter protein expression.",
