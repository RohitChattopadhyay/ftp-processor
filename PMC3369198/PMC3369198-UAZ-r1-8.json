  "verbose_text" : "The presence of pyridoxal, Mg 2+, and Mn 2+ can enhance ADC activity as well as that of other amino decarboxylases, but agmatine deiminase does not seem to be affected by the presence of these cofactors; conversely, arginine, glucose, and fructose have been shown to exert an inhibitory effect on AGM deamination, whereas high levels of AGM can enhance the production of PUT (Arena and Manca de Nadra, XREF_BIBR; EFSA Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ), XREF_BIBR; Landete et al., XREF_BIBR).",
