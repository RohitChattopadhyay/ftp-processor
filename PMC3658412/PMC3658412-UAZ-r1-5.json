  "verbose_text" : "This apparent contradiction may rely on the fact that interaction of NO with other reactive species results in loss of its regulatory properties; for instance, NO mediated activation of COX and subsequent release of beneficial and anti-inflammatory prostaglandins is lost when superoxide production is also enhanced, since interaction between superoxide and NO leads to in situ formation of peroxynitrite, a potent cytotoxic and proinflammatory reactive species [XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR].",
