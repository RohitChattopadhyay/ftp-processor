Both blank experiments in Figure XREF_FIG c give a similar result that is clearly different from the transient nitrite concentration profile in the experiment, allowing an estimation of the amount of NO 2 - that is converted based on the nitrite profiles in Figure XREF_FIG a, b and c. Initially, the nitrite conversion is significant as the breakthrough of NO 2 - is significantly delayed and 9.2.",
