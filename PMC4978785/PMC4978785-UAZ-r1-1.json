  "verbose_text" : "In addition to increasing catalytic activity, phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues results in recruitment and binding of signaling molecules that can activate three intracellular signaling cascades : 1) the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, which is generally thought to be critical for neuronal survival; 2) the phospholipase C pathway, which catalyzes the breakdown of lipids into diacylglycerol, resulting in activation of protein kinase C, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, resulting in an increase in Ca 2+ release from intracellular stores; and 3) the Ras / MAPK (microtubule associated protein kinase) cascade, which can phosphorylate and thereby activate or alter the activity of myriad proteins (including additional kinases); furthermore, the Ras / MAPK pathway can also effect changes in transcription via activation of transcription factors including cAMP response element binding protein (CREB).",
