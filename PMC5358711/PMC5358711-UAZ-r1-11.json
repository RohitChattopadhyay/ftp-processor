  "verbose_text" : "The possible mechanisms responsible for the promoting effects of ANXA1 on cell proliferation may include : i) ANXA1 has multiple phosphorylation sites, and can act as the receptor substrate of EGF / HGF and other growth signals, when proliferated by protein kinase C (PKC) or tyrosine kinase (TK), and it may then activate IKK, NF-kappaB and other downstream molecules, thus promoting cell proliferation; ii) combined with formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) on the cell surface, it participates in the induction of mitogen activated proliferation signals; iii) it acts as the transcriptional target of forkhead transcription factor FoxM1, thus promoting the proliferation, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis of tumor cells and iv) it inhibits tumor necrosis factor induced apoptosis.",
