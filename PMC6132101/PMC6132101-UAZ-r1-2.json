  "verbose_text" : "Rarely, treatment with levothyroxine may increase thyroid autoantibody production including TSAb, such that hypothyroid patients can later become hyperthyroid.4 It is hypothesized that elevated thyroid hormone, through thyroxine replacement, affects the immune system such that it inhibits T regulatory cells and enhances expression of costimulatory molecules by dendritic cells, which are both important in antibody production and TSAb secretion.4 Treatment with antithyroid medications such as carbimazole reduces thyroid autoimmunity and TSAb secretion,10 and following treatment the balance could switch to predominately TBAb.",
