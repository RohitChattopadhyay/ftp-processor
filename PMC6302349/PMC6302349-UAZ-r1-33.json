[XREF_BIBR] determined the suppressive role of RhoA/ROCK/MYPT1 pathway in lung cancer related invasion by pharmacological inhibition and RNA interference techniques; Yang et al. [XREF_BIBR] indicated that the change in MYPT1 phosphorylation (P-MYPT1) was one of the molecular mechanisms by which Rho-kinase inhibitor suppresses proliferation and metastasis of small lung cancer; Our previous study also revealed that microRNA-30d promoted angiogenesis and tumor growth via MYPT1/c-JUN/VEGFA pathway [XREF_BIBR].",
