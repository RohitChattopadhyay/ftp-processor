  "verbose_text" : "Neurotoxicity is a well recognized adverse effect of vincristine, and vincristine results in a mixed sensorimotor neuropathy or autonomic neuropathy (bladder atony, orthostatic hypotension, paralytic ileus).1 It is a dose dependent effect that typically occurs early in the course of treatment1 and while the pathogenesis of vincristine induced neuropathy remains unclear it may be related to an effect on microtubules resulting in malorientation of microtubules and neurofilaments.1 Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy resulting in vocal cord palsy (VCP) caused by vincristine has also been reported in literature, predominantly in the pediatric population.1, 2, 3, 4 Instant recognition and management of vincristine induced VCP is crucial because it is a potential fatal complication albeit one that can be completely reversed.",
