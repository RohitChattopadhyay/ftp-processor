[XREF_BIBR] developed an elegant, stereocontrolled syntheses of acortatarins A and B, however starting from expensive d-thymidine, using stoichiometric amounts of toxic mercury salt in the key step for acortatarin A. Recently, Kuwahara and coworkers [XREF_BIBR] reported their expeditious route for acortatarin A derived from elaborately protected chiral olefin, nevertheless, associated with higher cost and harsher deprotection / cyclization steps.",
