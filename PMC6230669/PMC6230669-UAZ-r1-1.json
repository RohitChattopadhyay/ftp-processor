  "verbose_text" : "This protein belongs to a family of 10 anoctamin proteins that function as calcium activated chloride channels of which the most is known about ANO1 and ANO2.6 ANO1 and ANO2 are known to function at the cell surface with roles in sensory transduction, secretion at the epithelial membrane, and smooth muscle contraction.7 It has been shown that ANO3 is not expressed at the cell surface but is an intracellular transmembrane protein likely working at the endoplasmic reticulum.3, 7 The ANO3 protein was highly expressed in brain tissue, specifically the striatum but also in the neocortex, hippocampus, and amygdala.3 Gene expression increases during development from the fetal stage to adolescence.8 Knowing the function of this protein as part of neuronal excitability with a location in the brain can potentially explain its role in dystonia; however, much remains unknown.",
