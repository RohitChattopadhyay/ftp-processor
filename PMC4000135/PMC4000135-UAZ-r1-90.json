[XREF_BIBR], who suggested that Kv2.1 proteins in CGNs are long lived on the surface of mammalian cells and that autophagy is the major cellular pathway for the degradation of long lived proteins and cytoplasmic organelles, we speculate that the GDF15 induced Akt / mTOR pathway negatively modulates the lysosomal degradation of Kv2.1, similar to how mTOR signalling is the principal negative regulator of macroautophagy [XREF_BIBR].",
