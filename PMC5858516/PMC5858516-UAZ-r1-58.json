Inhibition of HyFS mediated autophagy by inhibitors or RNA interference led to increased antiproliferation effects and a dramatic induction of cancer cell apoptosis, indicating that HyFS activates protective autophagy in lung cancer cells, which is different from previous studies XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR.",
