  "verbose_text" : "In our previous work we have presented a convenient approach towards the alpha specific and regioselective synthesis of Chlamydia related Kdo oligomers using 3-iodo-Kdo fluoride donor 1 for the coupling step followed by deiodination of the stereodirecting auxiliary group.7 Gratifyingly, the elimination reaction could also be largely suppressed, and the protocol was successfully expanded to include the formation of the sterically demanding alpha-(2--> 5)-linkage of Kdo units.8 In continuation of these applications, we have set out to investigate the suitability of donor 1 for the glycosylation of glucosamine acceptors, specifically addressing regioselective glycosylation at position 6 with the option for subsequent phosphorylation at position 4 in order to generate the common phosphoester substitution at the distal glucosamine unit of lipid A.2, 9 Results and Discussion.",
