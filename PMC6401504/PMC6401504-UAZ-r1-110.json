  "verbose_text" : "Tube formation and migration assays revealed that overexpressing miR-4306 or silencing SIX1 strongly abrogated the ability of TNBC cells to induce tube formation (with much lower tube density) and migration in HDLECs, whereas silencing miR-4306 in non TNBC cells or rescuing SIX1 expression in TNBC cells transfected with miR-4306 mimic promoted tube formation (with much higher tube density) and migration; these findings suggest that miR-4306 suppresses TNBC lymphangiogenesis by targeting the 3'UTR of SIX1 in vitro.",
