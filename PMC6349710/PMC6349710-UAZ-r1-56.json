  "verbose_text" : "For cytokine production, we knocked down Spred2 expression (~ 80% reduction) in adipocytes differentiated from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using short interfering (si) RNA and the cells were stimulated with TNFalpha (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. Spred2 knockdown did not alter the expression levels of de novo TNFalpha and MCP-1 as compared to the controls (data not shown), suggesting that the role of Spred2 in adipocyte cytokine production is minimal.",
