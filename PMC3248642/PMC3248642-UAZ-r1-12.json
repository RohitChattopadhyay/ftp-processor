For the conjugation of the Reppe Anhydride containing amino acids, the epsilon-amino function of Lys was selectively deprotected by treatment of the resin with 2% hydrazine monohydrate in DMF for 3 h. To the Lys residue the Fmoc protected diene derivatives were successively condensed four times as described above and the N terminal acid was acetylated.",
