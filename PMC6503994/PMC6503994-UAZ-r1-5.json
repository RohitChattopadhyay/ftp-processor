  "verbose_text" : "TXNIP induction under HG is also associated with mitochondrial membrane depolarization, as shown by a reduction in JC1 in XREF_FIG C and decreases in ATP levels in XREF_FIG D. Furthermore, cell viability is reduced under HG but this is rescued by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) (XREF_FIG E), suggesting that oxidative stress is involved in this process.",
