XREF_BIBR reported the renal IGF-1 protein is significantly upregulated in rats with Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced early DM, which is also related to renal compensatory hypertrophy and high filtration; Li et al. XREF_BIBR found the serum IGF-1 level is significantly increased in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy, which also increases the progress of DN, thus suggesting that IGF-1 may be closely related to the occurrence and development of DN XREF_BIBR.",
