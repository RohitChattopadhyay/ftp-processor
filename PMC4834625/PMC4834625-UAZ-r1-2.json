  "verbose_text" : "Common characterization techniques for SAMs include grazing incidence angle IR spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, and atomic force microscopy.7 SERS gives more localized, molecular information than grazing angle IR spectroscopy, whereas in the future, the combination with atomic force microscopy in tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy is expected to go to the extreme of combining both molecular information and nanoscale resolution.8 The few reactions in SAMs reported to date are observed by using atomic force microscopy,9 scanning tunneling microscopy,10 or SERS,10 b, 11 and are nearly all photoreactions, for example, UV induced photoisomerizations,10 a or dimerizations, either within a SAM of the pure reactant,11 b or in a diluted form.10b A typical heterogeneous catalytic reaction at a surface involves three separate steps, as shown in Figure XREF_FIG, whereas a reaction within a SAM follows 2 D reaction kinetics on the catalyst surface.",
