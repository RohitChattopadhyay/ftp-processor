Quantity RT-PCR results showed that miRNA expression levels were apparently increased after NRK49F was stimulated with AngII, as shown in Fig. XREF_FIG a. Transfection of NRK49F cells with miRNA-184 mimics and under stimulation with AngII resulted in a significant increase in alpha-SMA compared with negative control mimic transfected cells.",
