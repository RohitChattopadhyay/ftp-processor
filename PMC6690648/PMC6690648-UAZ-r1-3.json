XREF_BIBR reported a tendency for reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (p = 0.06), compared with a control group, Kullisaar et al. XREF_BIBR observed significant improvement in HbA1c, and Rajkumar et al. found that fasting glycemia and insulin levels were reduced in groups given supplementation with probiotics, omega-3, and both probiotics and omega-3 (p < 0.05).",
