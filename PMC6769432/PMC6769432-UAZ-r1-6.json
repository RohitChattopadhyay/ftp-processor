  "verbose_text" : "The marked differences in the geminal (2 J) couplings between the three silicon bound phosphorus atoms reflects presumably the dependence of the coupling interaction on the relative orientation of the phosphorus lone-pairs and has previously also been observed for the cis-trans-isomers of 5.3b The sensitivity of 2 J PP couplings towards conformational changes is well known both in general21 and in the chemistry of polyphosphorus compounds,22 and the observation of large magnitudes for \" through space \" couplings has been attributed to the overlap of the phosphorus lone-pairs in space.23 Similar temperature dependent changes as in the 31 P NMR data are also visible for the Cp- and tBu-resonances in the 1 H NMR spectra; e. g. a spectrum recorded at -40 degreesC displays four signals for the tert-butyl protons which coalesce pairwise to give the expected two averaged signals at higher temperature.",
