  "verbose_text" : "These silica supported chromium catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene have been extensively studied with infrared (IR) spectroscopy15, 16, 17 to elucidate the nature of the chromium polymerization sites.4, 18, 19 Most of the research included studies of model catalysts, where the main Cr species of the activated catalyst, that is, Cr 6+, are reduced with CO to Cr 2+ species.20 The catalyst in this form is afterwards examined with different probe molecules including CO, NO, and ethylene itself, in time-, temperature-, and pressure resolved experiments.21 To study this highly active system, temperatures and pressures are often set to very low values, that is, 77 K and under vacuum, which are needed to freeze possible reaction intermediates or examine the adsorption and desorption of probe molecules.13, 22, 23, 24 The experiments showed a high heterogeneity of Cr 2+ sites, classified into three families, that is, Cr 2 A, Cr 2+ B, and Cr 2+ C, with respect to their ability to coordinate probe molecules (A> B> C).",
