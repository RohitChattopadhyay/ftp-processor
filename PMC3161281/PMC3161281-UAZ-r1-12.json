  "verbose_text" : "This insulin sensitizing effect of GFT505 was probably linked to PPARdelta activation for the following reasons : 1) PPARalpha activation by fenofibrate does not improve hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity in glucose clamp studies; 2) similar to GFT505, the pure PPARdelta agonist GW501516 improves insulin resistance and glucose tolerance in mouse models of diabetes; 3) 2-week treatment with GW501516 decreases fasting plasma insulin and HOMA-IR in moderately obese men; and 4) there is not an increase in plasma adiponectin levels, a well-known marker of PPARgamma activity.",
