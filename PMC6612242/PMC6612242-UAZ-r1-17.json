[XREF_BIBR] reached a different conclusion in a study in which medical-grade silicon bands were wrapped around the distal colon to induce partial obstruction in wild-type and ICCs deficient (W/Wv) mice, demonstrating COX-2 mRNA level and circular muscle contractility, indicating that ICCs deficiency limits the effect on stretch induced expression of COX-2 and suppression of smooth muscle contractility in obstruction, which is consistent with our finding that mechanical stretch enhances BSMCs proliferation and contraction.",
