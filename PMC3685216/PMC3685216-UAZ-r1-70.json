  "verbose_text" : "The GLUT4 levels on the PM were lower in adipose tissue from the AS160-knockout mice at both basal and insulin stimulated states (XREF_FIG G and XREF_FIG H), whereas its fold-increase upon insulin stimulation was similar in the two genotypes (~ 2-fold in both genotypes; XREF_FIG G and XREF_FIG H), suggesting that AS160 deficiency does not impair insulin stimulated GLUT4 translocation itself, and the lower GLUT4 levels on the PM and glucose uptake upon insulin stimulation were most likely due to the decreased expression levels of GLUT4 in the AS160-knockout mice.",
