Di Chiara et al. have proposed in their review that hypoadiponectinemia is the most interesting new hypothesis to explain the pathophysiology of MetS; the review by Emanuela et al. also proposes inflammatory status as a link between obesity and MetS; L. Pala et al. in a case-control study assessed the relationship among several adipokines (adiponectin, retinol binding protein 4, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein, and visfatin) and incident CV diseases, and A. N. C. Simao et al. evaluated several markers related to MetS and their association to adiponectin levels.",
