  "verbose_text" : "Considering the findings that i) amlodipine treatment inhibited apoptosis more effectively than losartan but was less effective in preventing brain damage, ii) at 40 weeks there was no significant difference in apoptosis between SHRSP-Los16 and SHRSP-Veh, and iii) 16 weeks losartan treatment most effectively prevented SHRSP from stroke and improved brain function as evidenced by the greatly improved clinical scores of stroke, we conclude that suppressing apoptosis is not a significant mechanism by which losartan substantially improved brain function.",
