  "verbose_text" : "Ethylene is obtained in very small amounts because of the low stability of primary carbenium ions.12 When polymethylated benzenes contribute to methanol conversion as reaction intermediates, the ethylene yield is usually much higher because the polymethylated benzenes can undergo a series of gem methylation, deprotonation, side-chain methylation, and elimination reactions.13 Ultimately, the zeolite micropores become plugged because of the formation of polycyclic aromatics, high molecular weight polymeric carbon, amorphous carbon, and so forth.14 In 8MR zeolites, in which polymethylated benzenes15 cannot escape the scene of catalysis, the ethylene yield is typically much higher and deactivation more pronounced in comparison to zeolites with larger micropores.2d, 4a Performance in terms of product distribution and deactivation depends not only on the zeolite topology but also on the acidity of the zeolites.16 Focusing on H-ZSM-5, various approaches have been followed to modify its acidity, mainly to decrease coking deactivation and influence product selectivity.",
