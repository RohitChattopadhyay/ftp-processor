  "verbose_text" : "When Rh was deposited on different supports, mainly on reducible TiO 2, methane formation was dominant.36, 37, 38, 39 On Pd supported Al 2 O 3 catalysts, methane formation was dominant,36, 37, 38, 39 whereas using SiO 2, MgO and TiO 2 supports CO was the major product.37 The ratio of Ni : NiO also strongly determines the selectivity of the CO 2 hydrogenation : higher metallic content favors methane formation.29 All of these findings emphasize the importance of the nature of the metal / support interface.",
