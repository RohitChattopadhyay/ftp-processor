  "verbose_text" : "The cation A + is stable in the solid state at low temperature but does rearrange or decompose slowly at ambient temperature, putatively leading to an anthracenyl (acyl) hydridophosphnium F + that can be further deprotonated by the base triethylamine Et 3 N.4 Gas-phase DFT calculations supported the ion-pair A + Cl - but precluded the phosphenium E + as potential intermediates in the reaction with PhCOCl.4 As will be shown below, inclusion of solvation effects in the theoretical treatment for ionic species is essential to provide reliable energetics for such reactions in solution.",
