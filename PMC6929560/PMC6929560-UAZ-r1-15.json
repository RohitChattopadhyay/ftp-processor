  "verbose_text" : "To further explore the regulatory mechanism of the LAMA4 gene in preeclampsia, the VEGF and sFlt-1 mRNA levels in HTR-8 / SVneo cells were detected, showing that after the LAMA4 level was suppressed, the VEGF mRNA expression level was remarkably decreased, while the sFlt-1 mRNA expression level was clearly increased, indicating that the reduction of LAMA4 affects angiogenesis and inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion of HTR-8 / SVneo cells, thereby inducing and aggravating the development and progression of preeclampsia (XREF_FIG).",
