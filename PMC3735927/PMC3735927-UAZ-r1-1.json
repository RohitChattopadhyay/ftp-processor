  "verbose_text" : "Very small particles or gases will deposit in alveolar wall and cause inflammation there, leading to Subtype B or Subtype C. Similarly, small particles deposited in terminal bronchioles will cause destruction and/or dilatation of bronchioles, leading to Subtype A. CT scores and smoking index in both Subtype B and Subtype C were higher than Subtype A. Therefore, both Subtype B and Subtype C were visually progressive and more affected by cigarette smoking as compared to Subtype A. Subtype B and Subtype C have similar properties of peripheral border of LAA.",
