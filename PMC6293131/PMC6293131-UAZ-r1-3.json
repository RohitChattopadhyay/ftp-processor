  "verbose_text" : "FcRn does not bind IgG3, which therefore has a shorter half-life (7 days vs 21 days).4 Patients with mutations in the beta2-microglobulin gene (whose protein associates with FcRn and is necessary for proper FcRn functioning) have been described, who presented with low IgG levels, a faster-than-usual decline in specific antibody levels after vaccination, and a relatively mild infectious history.7, 8 To test whether a defect in FcRn mediated functions could explain our patient 's phenotype, we sequenced the FcRn gene as well as the B2M gene.",
