  "verbose_text" : "IL-17A promotes inflammation by several actions including : overexpression of antimicrobial peptides such as lipocalin2, human beta-defensin 2 and S100A proteins; secretion of several CXCR1- or CXCR2 bearing neutrophil chemoattractants such as CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6, and CXCL8, leading to neutrophil accumulation in psoriatic epidermis; increased production of CCL20, which is essential for the recruitment of both CCR6 expressing dendritic cells and T cells in lesional skin; high expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 on endothelial cells, which is essential for T-cell extravasation; dominant role in inducing the expression of psoriasis signature genes that are synergistically or additively co-regulated together with TNF-alpha, including IL-19, a potent inducer of epidermal hyperplasia, IL-6 and IL-23A (IL-23p19) [XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR].",
