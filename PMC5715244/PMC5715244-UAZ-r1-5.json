  "verbose_text" : "For example, arginine residues are frequently found in the RNA binding regions of proteins,2 b, 5 such as those in the human ribosomal protein L7 and the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) rev protein,6 and many pharmaceutically active compounds contain guanidinium moieties,7 such as antihypertensive drugs (e.g., amiloride, clonidine, guanethidine), antidiabetics (e.g., metformin, buformin, galegin), and antibiotics (e.g., streptomycin, sulfaguanidine).8 RNA-ligand complexes can be studied by using computational9 or experimental approaches such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,3 a, 10 X-ray crystallography,11 biochemical methods,12 and crosslinking strategies.12a, 13 Although highly promising native mass spectrometry (MS) studies of RNA-protein14 and RNA-drug15 complexes have continued to appear in the literature over the past 20 years, they are still scarce compared with those for protein protein interactions.16 This is quite surprising in view of the high stability of guanidinium-phosphate interactions in gaseous ions17 and the inherent advantages of native MS, for example, that it does not require stable isotope labeling or crystallization, is not limited by crosslinking reactivity, and uses only relatively small quantities of sample material compared with NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography.",
