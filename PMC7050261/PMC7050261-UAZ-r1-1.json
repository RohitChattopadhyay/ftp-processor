  "verbose_text" : "Glycosylation is the most common posttranslational modification, wherein over half of proteins are glycosylated.3 Glycosylation plays essential roles in various biological processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation, intercellular communication and signaling, cell-cell and protein protein interactions, cell adhesion, and immune responses.4a, 4b Moreover, glycosylation patterns exhibit protein-, cell- and tissue specific heterogeneity, thus enabling the assessment of changes in various pathological and physiological states such as tissue origin, tissue development, tumorigenesis, and the degree of malignancy.5a, 5b For instance, the core fucosylation of alpha-Fetoprotein L3 is a common diagnostic glycoprotein biomarker for hepatocarcinoma; and the glycan antigen sialyl-Le a is a common marker for gastrointestinal cancer.6a, 6b, 6c, 6d Additionally, many tumors have been reported to show significantly increased expression of truncated O-glycans and N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine-branching N-glycan.7a, 7b Therefore, glycomic profiling of tissues under different physiopathological states may contribute to the discovery of biomarkers that are associated with tissue- or disease specific alterations.",
